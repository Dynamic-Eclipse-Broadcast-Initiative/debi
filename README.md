# debi
Dynamic Eclipse Broadcast Initiative

## Quick Start

If you are already familiar with using git through something like VS Code, or Git Desktop,
you can get the code from [https://github.com/Dynamic-Eclipse-Broadcast-Initiative/debi.git](here).
```
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
git clone https://github.com/Dynamic-Eclipse-Broadcast-Initiative/debi.git
```
to fetch the scripts to your system.

Once you've fetched the scripts, you can update them with `git pull`


The target platform is Microsoft Windows.

## Organization

We don't have much software defined yet.  So the organization is probably wrong.

* capture -- for scripts to assist in capturing images (e.g. SharpCap)
* analysis -- image processing scripts
